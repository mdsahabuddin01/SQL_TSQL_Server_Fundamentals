1. Understand relational databases and their attributes.
  Query meta-information about a database using information_schema.
  Create tables, modify their structure, and migrate data into them.
  Learn how to add, rename, and drop columns, as well as delete entire tables.

  Key Lessons:
  Introduction to relational databases.
  Creating and modifying tables.
  Migrating data with INSERT INTO SELECT DISTINCT.

2. Enforce Data Consistency with Attribute Constraints
  After building a simple database, focus on ensuring data quality using constraints. This includes:

  Specifying column data types and enforcing rules like uniqueness.
  Disallowing NULL values, using the SET NOT NULL constraint.
  Applying constraints to ensure the data adheres to certain standards.
  
  Key Lessons:
  Working with constraints such as NOT NULL and UNIQUE.
  Understanding and changing data types with ALTER COLUMN.

3. Uniquely Identify Records with Key Constraints
  the use of primary and foreign keys to uniquely identify records and establish relationships between tables.

  Understand and define primary keys.
  Learn about surrogate keys and how to create them.
  Use SELECT COUNT DISTINCT to identify unique records.

  Key Lessons:
  Defining primary and foreign keys.
  Creating surrogate keys.

4. Glue Together Tables with Foreign Keys
  In the final chapter, connect tables using foreign keys and explore the concept of referential integrity:

  Model one-to-many relationships between tables.
  Run JOIN queries to connect data across tables.
  Understand referential integrity violations and how to handle them.

  Key Lessons:

  Implementing foreign keys and understanding their impact.
  Running complex JOIN queries across multiple tables.
